			<h2>What's New</h2>
			<div>
				<div>Another update.  August 17</div>
				<p>Got the voice component into what seems to be a pretty solid state.  Started working on
					restoring the web component.  Decided to take a different approach, and start with a 
					configuration interface.  What this means is now registration and group configuration
					can happen without my involvment at all.  I guess that also means Chip is open to the public.
				</p>

				<p>
					I've just finished a major rebuild of chip (August 2014).  There are many new exciting features
					and other improvements to allow him to function more automatically.  However, as a part of the rewrite
					I've had to remove the website as it was holding back new improvements.  Hopefully I'll have time
					to restore it sometime.  Here's some cool new features
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Can run for as many syndicates as he wants</li>
					<li>Imported member data will not be shared between syndicates</li>
					<li>War intel will be shared between syndicates</li>
					<li>"Like"-based roll call</li>
					<li>Configuration commands (ident, mystats)</li>
					<li>Member spreadsheet no longer required</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					I've also added a <a href="/help">commands page</a> which I will try to keep updated with
					descriptions of the available commands
